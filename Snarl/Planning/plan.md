For this project, we opted to use functional style and chose a data-oriented design to represent Snarl. We use Python dictionaries for all major components of the game (dungeons, levels, players, etc). Dungeon, being the top-most game component, contains within it all of the necessary data structures to represent the state of the game at any given time. The dungeon has access to all components âbelowâ it and any piece of data can be accessed with the appropriate keys or indices. In this sense, all of our components are dumb and do not know how to change themselves. Only user events will call functions that compute updated components that then become rendered for a user. As the game becomes networked, we anticipate that this will be conducive to maintaining global state as each client doesnât have to know how to interpret changes, but only has to receive the new state, and render it. We also believe that by planning to use JSON for data interchange, parsing updates will be a straightforward conversion to our chosen data representation.

Levels that are a part of the dungeon dictionary, hold information specific to the level (such as location of keys, exits, the map of the board, etc.). Inside a level, a board can represent both rooms and hallways and essentially maps out the dimensions, items, players, and the enemies within it. Each player in a room contains a name, health information, location, and perhaps game board vision.  
The dungeon contains a list of player names which can be used to access players in the room if needed.

Our envisioned Modules are simple collections of functions which take a state and return a state. There are 4 main modules as of now which are collections of functions with different responsibilities and return updated state. The first is the Creation module which will encompass functions that generate and initialize the game. These we anticipate will take 2 weeks to complete and represent the first two milestones. At this point, we would have enough to render a static view of the game and demo to the rest of the team. Second, we have the Movement module which allows basic movement for players and enemies to progress the game. This we estimate will take 1 - 1.5 weeks to complete. Next, we would need to âplug inâ the movement functions to event handlers in the static view. Third, we have the Network module which will allow us to implement multiplayer games, tournaments, and interact with the game from the command line through sockets. This will be a significant portion of the project, consisting of 2-3 weeks of work. This will be a functioning prototype of the product. Finally, the fourth module will consist of add-ons which include things like power ups and health benefits. This is not integral to the program, and therefore comes in last. This will take 1-2 weeks.
